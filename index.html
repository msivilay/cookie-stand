        <h4>Our Story:</h4>
        <p>
        Back in 2009, our beloved founder Pat Simpkins had two busy children who loved to be involved in sports, music, and youth groups. Pat found herself constantly in need of something to contribute to the many bake sales. She took inspiration from her Pacific Northwest surroundings and created the salmon cookie. The first salmon cookie is what you see here on the image to the left. Needed a little work don't you think? Well, she spent hours in the kitchen until she created the salmon cookies we all know and love today. People loved her bake-sale creations and became an instant sensation! We now have 5 international store locations and continue to grow. They are also available for you to order online. Delicious and beautifully frosted shortbread cookies in the shape of the beloved chinook salmon of the Pacific Northwest are waiting for you! We hope you enjoy our cookies and fun related items to help you bring salmon joy to your home! Click on the button below to subscribe to our updates.
